            Entering the JavaScript chapter this week, I now learned a brand new way of performing art through the help of technologies and possibilities of art turnouts as they appear in the imagined society. As beginners, we are mostly focused on basic shapes and base structures in the process of building up an entirely associated and constructed artwork, which reminded me of the contrasts between the simple commands and the complexity of the big construction.

            For me, coding itself can be valued as a way of art practice, in which the creator has been given the ability and opportunity to establish interesting creations or artistic accomplishments using their tools through their ways. Art can be achieved in multiple ways, coding being one of the largest one in the perspectives of overall concept and art making way.

            As a takeaway of the previous chapter, websites are working distinctively different from codes of commands or executions, but has in fact provided a welcoming and enriching environment for the developments among code creations and Community building.

            When creating complex shapes or layered images, a thing that has stood out to me was the importance of having a clear logic in mind and keep things ordered, for the eventual outcome to be shown as disciplined; that ability of arranging different elements and order them is not only important for building up images using simple shapes, but also crucial when planning out and filling in the structures for larger digital mediums.
